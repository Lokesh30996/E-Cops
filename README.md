# E Cops #

----------
## Scope ##

An online solution is very useful as the solution is inherently distributive. This distributive characteristic of the online solution helps in getting the different police stations to share information and get in contact with one another. With respect to ECOPS, going forward, the aim is to develop new technologies that include designing new techniques to fight crime and improve criminal justice. Plans are afoot to embed multi-purpose technologies such as traffic management, mobile data techniques, warrants, personnel scheduling, gang activity analysis, field reporting, human resource development of police personnel, etc.                           For the police, initiatives such as ECOPS are designed to improve their long-term relations with the citizens due to effective feedback and faster exchange of critical information between various departments and police stations.

## Proposed System ##

An online solution is very useful as the solution is inherently distributive. This distributive characteristic of the online solution helps in getting the different police stations to share information and get in contact with one another. Information about the criminals and the police is also made available to the people in this system. 
Our work is divided into 2 modules:

- User
- Police


User:

User can send complaints to police in any issue of disturbance or problem. He can verify the status of the registered complaint. He can do his work only when he logs in with correct username or password. If he want to create any new account, he can even register himself through Registration Form. The user can check status by complaint id only.

Police:

Basing on the complaints given by the public, police can view them and take appropriate action timely. The police has to login with their account to view the complaints and to send the status of the complaints to the users. They can update the status of the complaint basing on the progress of investigation. Police also can register if the person is new to department.
